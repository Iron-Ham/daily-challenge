1. Write a program in Java to solve the 8 queens problem using genetic
algorithms.  Play around with the mutation rate, the crossover point and the
function to choose which combinations will “reproduce”.  Report your findings.

2.  Write a program in Java to solve the 8 queens problem using simulated
annealing.  Play around with the error rate, the temperature, and how quickly
the temperature decreases.  Report your findings.

3. (Bonus, helped me get in the swing of the problem). Write an algorithm to
print all ways of arranging eight queens on an 8x8 chess board so that none of
them share the same row, column, or diagonal.
